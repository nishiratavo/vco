# vco
Eurorack VCO based on Juno-106 with STM32F103

The development environment is based on the repos [STM32-base](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base) and 
[STM32-base-STM32Cube](https://github.com/STM32-base/STM32-base-STM32Cube), following the steps in the [guide](https://stm32-base.org/guides/setup).

I made some changes to the makefile, so the tools folder should be in the root of the git repo. The tools folder is the same as described in the [guide](https://stm32-base.org/guides/setup).
